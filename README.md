# no t.co

This Safari extension simply watches your tweet stream and replaces all t.co links with their original, expanded URLs. Yep, that's about it. This will probably never make its way onto the Safari extensions gallery, but you can download a prepackaged version right [here](https://github.com/dlo/no-t.co/releases/download/1.0/no.t.co.safariextz).
